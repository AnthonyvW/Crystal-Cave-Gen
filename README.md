The goals for the generation to achieve are listed below.
  - Generate a cave-like foreground
  - Generate a background with gaps exposed to air
  - Have a background border around some, but not all foreground tiles
  - Generate stalagmites and stalactites in the foreground and background
  - Easy to customize

The resulting image generated by the code can be seen below.
